            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">NestBud Gardening ("we," "our," or "us") uses cookies and similar tracking technologies to enhance your experience on our website. This Cookie Policy explains what cookies are, how we use them, the types of cookies we use, and how you can manage your cookie preferences.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700">By continuing to use our website, you consent to our use of cookies in accordance with this policy. Cookies help us provide you with a better, more personalized experience and allow us to improve our services.

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-blue-800 mb-3">1. What Are Cookies?</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700">Cookies are small text files placed on your device when you visit websites. They store information about your browsing activities and preferences. Unlike most website data stored on servers, cookies are stored directly on your device. They cannot carry viruses or install malware. Cookies perform essential functions like remembering login details or site preferences. Modern websites typically use multiple types of cookies for different purposes, from basic functionality to complex analytics.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Point 2 -->
            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-blue-800 mb-3">2. Types of Cookies We Use</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700">We utilize several cookie categories: strictly necessary (essential for functionality), performance (for analytics), functionality (for personalization), and targeting/advertising (for relevant content). Session cookies expire when you close your browser, while persistent cookies remain until deleted. First-party cookies come from our domain, third-party from partners like Google Analytics. Each type serves specific purposes to enhance your experience while maintaining security.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Point 3 -->
            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-blue-800 mb-3">3. Strictly Necessary Cookies</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700">These essential cookies enable core website functionality and security features. They include login session cookies, shopping cart cookies, and fraud prevention cookies. Without these, services you request cannot be properly provided. They don't store personal data and are typically first-party session cookies. Even if you reject other cookies, these will still be placed when you engage with key site features. They help maintain your session security and prevent fraudulent activity.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-blue-800 mb-3">4. Performance Cookies</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700">Performance cookies collect anonymous information about how visitors use our site. They help us understand traffic patterns, popular pages, and user navigation paths. This data informs our development priorities and helps us improve site speed and usability. These cookies don't collect personally identifiable information, and the data is aggregated for analysis. Common examples include Google Analytics cookies that track page views and visit duration.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-blue-800 mb-3">5. Functionality Cookies</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700">Functionality cookies remember your preferences and choices to personalize your experience. These might include language preferences, region settings, or customized layout selections. They enable features like remembering your login details or form autofill information. While convenient, these are not strictly necessary for basic functionality. We only activate these cookies when you explicitly choose preferences or customize settings.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Point 6 -->
            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-blue-800 mb-3">6. Targeting/Advertising Cookies</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700">These cookies track browsing habits to deliver relevant advertising. They note which pages you visit to build a profile of your interests. This helps us show you ads that are more likely to be interesting. They're also used to limit ad frequency and measure campaign effectiveness. While useful for marketing, these are the most privacy-intrusive cookies. We provide clear options to opt-out of such tracking if preferred.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-blue-800 mb-3">7. Cookie Lifespan</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700">Different cookies remain active for varying durations: session cookies expire when you close your browser; persistent cookies may last from hours to several years. We set reasonable expiration periods based on purpose - authentication cookies might last for days, while preference cookies persist longer. Third-party cookies follow their providers' policies. We regularly review cookie durations to balance functionality with privacy considerations.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Point 8 -->
            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-blue-800 mb-3">8. Third-Party Cookies</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700">We partner with trusted third parties who may set cookies for services like analytics, advertising, and embedded content. Examples include Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, and YouTube embedded videos. These parties have their own privacy policies governing data use. While we vet partners carefully, we can't directly control their cookies. Our cookie consent tool lets you block third-party cookies specifically if desired.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-blue-800 mb-3">9. Local Storage & Similar Technologies</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700">Beyond cookies, we use HTML5 local storage for larger data storage needs. This allows remembering more complex preferences without constant server communication. Other technologies like web beacons and tracking pixels help measure page effectiveness. These work similarly to cookies but aren't blocked by typical cookie controls. We include these in our cookie policy for transparency and provide options to limit their use.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Point 10 -->
            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-blue-800 mb-3">10. Cookie Consent Management</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700">We implement a robust consent management system that records your preferences. When you first visit, you'll see clear options to accept, customize, or reject non-essential cookies. Your choices are saved and respected on return visits. You can update preferences anytime through our cookie settings panel. We maintain records of consent to demonstrate compliance with privacy regulations. Our system automatically blocks unconsented cookies from loading.</p>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-blue-800 mb-3">11. Browser Cookie Controls</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700">All modern browsers allow cookie management through settings menus. You can delete existing cookies, block future ones, or set preferences for specific sites. However, blocking all cookies might break certain website functionality. Browsers also offer private/incognito modes that don't save cookies after closing. We recommend reviewing your browser's help resources to understand these controls. Note that browser settings override our consent tool preferences.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-blue-800 mb-3">12. Impact of Disabling Cookies</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700">While you can disable cookies, this may significantly affect website functionality. Without cookies, you might need to re-enter information repeatedly, lose customizations between visits, or experience broken features. E-commerce functions like shopping carts generally require cookies. Some site sections might become inaccessible. We aim to minimize cookie dependencies while maintaining core functionality for users who opt-out.</p>

                <p class="text-gray-700">We periodically update this policy as technologies and regulations evolve. Significant changes will be announced through website notices. The "last updated" date at the top reflects the most recent revision. We encourage periodic review of this policy to stay informed. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated terms. Historic versions are archived for reference upon request.</p>

                <p class="text-gray-700">Our cookie practices comply with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We obtain explicit consent before setting non-essential cookies for EU visitors. Our consent management tool meets GDPR requirements for transparency and user control. We document all consents and provide easy withdrawal options. Data collected via cookies is processed according to our Privacy Policy and GDPR principles.</p>

                <p class="text-gray-700">For California residents under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), we provide specific cookie controls and disclosures. You have the right to opt-out of "sales" of personal information collected via cookies. Our "Do Not Sell My Personal Information" link appears in the footer. We honor browser-based opt-out signals where technically feasible. CCPA requests can be submitted through our designated channels.</p>

                <p class="text-gray-700">We don't knowingly use cookies to collect data from children under 16 without parental consent. Where age verification indicates a minor, we restrict certain tracking cookies. Parents can review or delete children's data by contacting us. Our services generally target adult gardeners and property owners. We comply with COPPA and similar child protection regulations globally.</p>

                <p class="text-gray-700">We implement strong security measures for cookie data transmission and storage. Sensitive cookies use secure, HTTP-only flags to prevent interception. Session cookies expire quickly to limit exposure. While cookies themselves can't directly compromise systems, we minimize sensitive data storage in them. Regular security audits evaluate our cookie practices against emerging threats and best practices.</p>

We participate in self-regulatory programs for online behavioral advertising. Our cookie banner includes AdChoices links for ad personalization controls. We comply with IAB Europe's Transparency & Consent Framework for programmatic advertising.</p>

                <p class="text-gray-700">We maintain a current cookie inventory detailing each cookie's purpose, duration, and data collected. Regular audits identify new or changed cookies across our digital properties. This inventory informs our cookie policy updates and consent management configuration. Third-party scripts are vetted for cookie practices before integration. Unexpected cookies trigger investigation and policy review.</p>

We aim to balance functionality with speed, ensuring that cookies enhance rather than hinder user experience. Performance metrics guide our cookie management decisions, allowing us to refine our approach continually.

We recognize that mobile browsing habits differ, so we optimize our cookie banner for smaller screens.
